Intro to C++
=============
	History
		Different standards in C++
		
	Introduction to OOP
		Abstraction
		Encapsulation
		Inheritance
		Polymorphism
		
			you can save using 
				.C 
				.cc 
				.cpp 
				
				
		Function Overloading:
		=====================
			Two or more functions with same name, but different signature
			What is signature of a function?
				The name, number of arguments and type of arguments, order in which arguments that are passed.
				
				
			In order to support function overloading your compiler performs name mangling/decoration during compilation (Phase I)	
			
			for Example:
			============
				void fun(); ---> _Z3funv
				
				void fun(int); --> _Z3funi
				void fun(double); -->_Z3fund
				void fun(char *);
				void fun(string);
				void fun(float);
				void fun(char);
				
				void fun(int,int);
				void fun(double, double);
				void fun(int,double);
				void fun(double, int);
=====================================================		

		In C language you used...
			char str[] ="String here " // can be used as read and writable 
			char *str = "string stored like this" //should be used as read only
		In C++ in addition to above 
			we can use 
				string str = "Some C++ strings here"
					here string is a class part of standard C++ library
		fun(str);
		void fun(char *str){
		
		}
		
		fun("Fun should not be called like this");
		
		char str[] = "Some more string here";
		fun(str);
		
		
		cin>>var;
		cin.getline(str,100)
		
		
		Write a structure...
			id, name and salary
			
			create an array of structure variable for storing 5 Employee details
			write functions to accept Employee details and to print it.
				acceptDetails()
				printDetails()
