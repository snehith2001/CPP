	Exception Saftey classes/object...			
	Built in exception classes 
		There are two main categories of exception classes in C++:
		
		Logic errors:
			are errors that can be detected by reading the code. For example, trying to divide by zero is a logic error.
		Runtime errors:
			are errors that cannot be detected by reading the code. For example, trying to open a file that does not exist is a runtime error.
			
The following table shows some of the most common exception classes in C++:
		
Class					Description
=======================================================
std::logic_error		Base class for all logic errors.
std::domain_error		Thrown when an invalid argument is passed to a function.
std::invalid_argument	Thrown when an invalid argument is passed to a function.
std::length_error		Thrown when an attempt is made to access an element of an array that is out of bounds.
std::out_of_range		Thrown when an attempt is made to access an element of an array that is out of bounds.
std::runtime_error		Base class for all runtime errors.
std::range_error		Thrown when an attempt is made to access an element of an array that is out of bounds.
std::overflow_error		Thrown when an attempt is made to perform an arithmetic operation that results in an overflow.
std::underflow_error	Thrown when an attempt is made to perform an arithmetic operation that results in an underflow.
