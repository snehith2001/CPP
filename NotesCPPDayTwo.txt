Day 2:
------
Structures Continued...
	C Style structures 
	C Style structures  using reference variables 
	C++ Style structures by bringing data and functions together
	

1. Using arrays 
		class Array{
			int arr[SIZE];
			int size;
		public:
			void initializeArr();
			void fillArray(int first);
			void printArray();
		};
		
2. Using Linked List
		
		struct Node{
			int data;
			Node *next;
		};
		
		class LinkedList{
			Node *first;
		public:
			void initialize();
			void addAtBeg();
			void addAtEnd();
			void addAtPos(int);
			void disp();
		};
		
	////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	There are special functions that can be used for initialization and de-initialization called as constructors and destructor
	
	Constructors:
	-------------
		Constructors are special functions which are automatically called when an object/variable/instance of a class is created
		
		These constructors can take argument, because it takes arguments the signature of these functions can vary (That means) these functions can be overloaded
		
		Destructor is a special function which gets called automatically when the scope of the variable/instance is gone.

		Destructor does not take any arguments, so it cannot be overloaded in a class 

	What is special about constructors:
	===================================
		There are 3 points that make constructors special
			1. Same name as class name 
			2. It does not have any return value (not even void)
			3. The are automatically called. 
			
		Destructor:
		-----------
			1. name starts with ~ClassName 
			2. no return types 
			3. automatically called
